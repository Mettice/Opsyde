## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- CrewAI (v0.21.0 or higher) for running exported workflows

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/efuet/crewbuilder.git
cd crewbuilder

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to start using CrewBuilder.

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Creating Your First Workflow
1. **Add Agents**: Click the "Add Agent" button to create AI team members
2. **Add Tasks**: Click "Add Task" to create jobs for your agents
3. **Add Tools**: (Optional) Add tools to extend agent capabilities
4. **Create Connections**:
   - Connect agents to tasks they should perform
   - Connect tools to agents that should use them
   - Connect tasks to establish dependencies
5. **Preview**: Test your workflow in preview mode
6. **Export**: Generate code to use with CrewAI

### Crews vs Flows
CrewBuilder supports both of CrewAI's workflow paradigms:
- **Crews**: Autonomous agents that collaborate with minimal supervision
- **Flows**: Sequential processes with precise control over execution order

Choose the approach that best fits your use case, or combine them for complex workflows.

### Example Workflow: Research Assistant
1. Create a "Researcher" agent with web search capabilities
2. Create a "Writer" agent for summarizing findings
3. Add tasks: "Gather Information" and "Write Summary"
4. Connect the Researcher to the "Gather Information" task
5. Connect the Writer to the "Write Summary" task
6. Create a dependency between the two tasks
7. Export as Python code

## üß© Components

### Agents
Agents are AI team members with specific roles and capabilities. Each agent has:
- **Role**: The specific job or function within the crew
- **Goal**: What the agent is trying to achieve
- **Backstory**: Background information that shapes the agent's approach
- **LLM Model**: The AI model powering the agent
- **Settings**: Options for delegation, verbosity, etc.

### Tasks
Tasks are specific jobs assigned to agents. They include:
- **Description**: What needs to be done
- **Expected Output**: The format and content of what should be produced
- **Execution Settings**: Synchronous or asynchronous execution
- **Dependencies**: Other tasks that must complete first

### Tools
Tools extend agent capabilities by providing access to external services or functions:
- **Web Search**: Find information online
- **Calculator**: Perform mathematical operations
- **API Tools**: Connect to external services
- **Custom Tools**: Create specialized capabilities

## üîÑ Workflow
The workflow connects agents, tasks, and tools to solve complex problems collaboratively:
- **Agent ‚Üí Task**: Assigns a task to an agent
- **Tool ‚Üí Agent**: Gives an agent access to a tool
- **Task ‚Üí Task**: Creates a dependency between tasks

## üì§ Export Options
CrewBuilder generates code that can be used with the CrewAI framework:

### Python
```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

# Agents
researcher = Agent(
    role="Researcher",
    goal="Find accurate information",
    backstory="Experienced researcher with attention to detail",
    verbose=True
)

# Tasks
research_task = Task(
    description="Research the topic",
    expected_output="Comprehensive report",
    agent=researcher
)

# Create the crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher],
    tasks=[research_task],
    verbose=True
)
result = crew.kickoff()
```

### YAML
```yaml
crew:
  name: Research Crew
  description: A crew for researching topics
  agents:
    - name: researcher
      role: Researcher
      goal: Find accurate information
      backstory: Experienced researcher with attention to detail
      verbose: true
  tasks:
    - name: research_task
      description: Research the topic
      expected_output: Comprehensive report
      agent: researcher
```

# CrewBuilder Frontend

The frontend application for CrewBuilder, built with React and ReactFlow.

## Overview

This frontend provides a visual interface for designing AI agent workflows. It allows users to:
- Create and connect different types of nodes (agents, tasks, tools)
- Configure node properties through a user-friendly interface
- Run workflows and view execution results in real-time
- Export workflows and results in various formats

## Key Components

- **BuilderPage**: Main workflow editor page
- **FlowCanvas**: ReactFlow canvas for the node editor
- **NodeTypes**: Custom node components for agents, tasks, and tools
- **Panels**: UI panels for templates, help, and execution results
